## Structural Representation Patterns

### Parameter Tree Pattern

Problem: A simple message format has been defined, like Atomic parameter or Atomic parameter list. But this simple message format does not fully satisfy the information need of the message receiver.

Forces:

- Expressiveness and efficiency have to be balanced.
- Interoperability
- Serialization time
- Learning effort and maintainability
  - security -\> checks forgotten

Solution: The solution is to organize the data in a message echange format, like JSON or XML. A primary container called root is created, that can hold various kinds of data structures, like tuples (which combine different types of data, such as a ZIP code and a city name) or arrays (which group elements with the same structure).

These structures can then be nested inside of each other.

Liabilities:

- Big tree can cause serialization issues
- Different trees might be requested -\> too many requests
- Tree structure needs to be perfectly documented -\> otherwise hell to maintain or use
- Accept everything, but send only what you specified
  - Specify upper and lower boundaries -\> arrays
  - Be specific about possible null values
- careful with complex structures such as key-value mappings -\> see networkmanager dbus

Uses:

- Notification dbus

## Parameter Forest Pattern

### Forces same as above

Problem: What if I want multiple trees?

Solution: Use multiple trees on the top level.

Liabilities:

- limit the number of trees
- provide tests and use suitable messaging formats such as xml or json
- be careful with spikes -\> trees that might be extremely big or small
  - worse performance
  - harder to maintain
  - harder to protect against tampering

Notes:

- can have multiple roots -\> multiple trees

## Pagination Pattern

Problem: How to provide large amounts of data that doesn't really fit into a single response.

Solution:

- send only parts (agreed upon fixed size or dynamic)
- The pattern has variants such as Offset-Based Pagination, Cursor-Based Pagination (also known as Token-Based Pagination) and Time-Based Pagination
- The default page-based Pagination and its Offset-Based Pagination variant are quite similar

Forces:

- Page size -\> how much do we send/receive?
- Variability of data (Identically structured? How often data definition changes)
- Memory available for a request (both on provider and on consumer side) and data currentness

Liabilities:

- pattern needs to be applied consistently
- max size needs to be chosen carefully
- pagination is of limited use when all data is loaded either way
- additional pages should be included with dymanic links that are timestamped
- big datasizes lead to potential DDOS, problems with packet sizes, performance issues especially without serialization libraries
