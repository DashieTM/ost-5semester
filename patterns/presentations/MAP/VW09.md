## Game Loop basics

The game loop has the following base functionality that it needs to implement:

```c
while(true) {
  // handle user input
  process_input();
  // move player, move objects, enemies etc
  update();
  // after moving we update the UI
  render();
  // move time forward -> see below
}
```

## Fixed Time Step with No Synchronization:

Run the game loop as fast as possible without synchronization. This was mostly used in the early days of gaming.

Benefits:

- Simple implementation 

Liabilities:
- Game speed directly affected by hardware and complexity.
- Gameplay is faster on a fast machine Liabilities:

## Fixed Time Step with Synchronization:

Run the game at a fixed time step but add a delay or synchronization point to prevent it from running too fast.

Benefits:

- Relatively simple with added power efficiency and doesn’t play too fast
- saves power
- good when implemented as option -\> fps slider

Liabilities:
- Game can still play too slowly if updates take too long
- CPU thread scheduling is not guaranteed
- bad when forced -\> NFS Rivals

## Variable Time Step

Adapt to playing both too slowly and too fast by adjusting the time step.

Benefits:
- Adaptable to varying processing speeds.

Liabilities:
- Makes gameplay non-deterministic and unstable. Can complicate physics and networking.
  - aka ball moves through wall randomly cuz fun
- Update function is called every frame, with 180frames per second this is 180 times, with 60 frames this is 60 times -> hence the first pc will have more update calls than the second.
  This will create a floating point error delta between the two PCs.

Example from bevy:

```rs
 transform.translation.y -= 50. * bullet.speed * timer.delta_seconds();
```

## Fixed Update Time Step, Variable Rendering:

Update with a fixed time step but drop rendering frames if necessary to catch up to the player's clock.

Benefits:

- Adapts to playing both too slowly and too fast, providing smoother gameplay on high-end machines.
- Floating point error delta between different pcs eliminated.

Liabilities:
- More complex implementation, requiring tuning of the update time step for different hardware.

```c
// variable rendering with:
render(lag / MS_PER_UPDATE);
// visibly move objects -> physics is not changed, player just sees something as "moved"
```

## Prüfungsfragen

- Fixed update time step solves the issue of floating point errors.\[yes\]
- Fixed time stamp with no synchronization is the preferred variant by gamers.\[no\]
