# Auftrag 3
Moderator: Nick Götti

## Version Identifier
Problem: How can an API provider indicate its current capabilities as well as the existence of possibly incompatible changes to clients?

Forces:
- Accuracy and exact API version
- Minimizing impact on client
- Guaranteeing API changes don't cause accidental breakage
- Traceability for versions

Solution: Introduce an explicit version number into the exchanged messages to indicate the API version.

Examples:
Version of representation format
![represenation](uploads/f55758d145d702374870c5721495a8be/represenation.png)

Specific operation
![operation](uploads/2e2d3801a405b2dff4b85c5c7b8792b1/operation.png)

Whole Api

JSON payload

benefits:
- Reduces likelihood of breakage because of api changes
- Makes version tracing possible
- Helps to identify proper API early

Liabilities:
- Governance
- Version changes don't always introduce changes in functionality

## Semantic Versioning
Problem: How can stakeholders compare API versions to immediately detect whether they're compatible? How to differentiate between bug fixes and breaking changes?

Forces:
- Minimal effort to detect version incompatability
- Manageability of api versions
- Clarity of change impact

Solution: Introduce a hierarchical three-number versioning (e.g 1.1.1)

Example:
![versioning](uploads/c834347ce17c41236f0b9aac97d2a026/versioning.png)

Benefits:
- Clarity for clients about compatibility

Liabilities:
- Increased effort to determine version identifiers

## Two in Production
Problem: How can a provider gradually update an API without breaking existing clients, but also without having to maintain a large number of API versions in production?

Forces:
- Ability to roll back API
- Minimize changes to the client by API
- Minimize maintenance effort for clients and server
- Time for clients to implement changes

Solution: Deploy and support two versions of an API endpoint. Update and decommission (i.e. deprecate and remove) the versions in a rolling, overlapping fashion

Benefits:
- Clients have time to implement new API
- Reduces likelihood of undetected changes further

Example:
![rollout](uploads/91b75328686095c4f5878b8cb567b2ee/rollout.png)

Liabilities:
- Clients have to adapt to incompatible API changes over time
- Causes additional costs for operating multiple API versions

## Limited Life time Guarantee 
Problem: How can a provider let clients know for how long they can rely on the published version of an API?

Forces:
- plannable API changes
- maintenance effort

Solution: As an API provider, guarantee to not break the published API for a given, fixed timeframe.

Benefits:
- No multi version support needed
- Clients know about changes
- Clients have enough time to change API

Liabilities:
- Limits ability to respond to urgent change requests
- Forces clients to upgrade at a defined point in time
- Clients do not always update API even with this method -> see windows EOL

## Prüfungsfragen
- Should fixes only increment the third part of the semantic versioning?(1.1.0 -> 1.1.1) [yes]
- Semantic versioning makes it easier to differentiate between bug fixes and breaking changes in an API [yes]
