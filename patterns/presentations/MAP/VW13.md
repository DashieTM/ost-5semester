## Event Queue
How to decouple the sending of an event/message from when it is processed.

Problem:
User input needs to be stored to prevent the operating system from forgetting it between receiving input and processing it.

Solution:
Store it in a queue.
For example: A Combat Code can send events, such as "enemy died," and any system can receive events from the queue, then a tutorial system can display "Press x to loot" over a dead enemy.

## Interrupts vs. Events
Interrupts are abrupt, immediately disrupting any ongoing workflows via the operating system.
In contrast, events can be queued up and are handled when the program in question decides to do so.

## Context
Events can facilitate the queuing of activities with specific requirements:

*Concurrency*: Events can be handled at any time, ensuring that they do not block the main loop with activities like loading.

*Prioritization*: Instances where similar events occur frequently, such as in sound processing, require prioritization.

*Memory*:
Event queues provide limited storage for events.
    - This aligns with concurrency, allowing events to be handled asynchronously.
    - By storing events and deferring their processing, we avoid simultaneous access from multiple sources to the audio thread, preventing blocking behavior.

### Central vs. Local
- Central is global -> anyone can send/get events to/from it.
- Centralization can lead to problems:
  - Different event types
  - Size

## Benefits
- Concurrency
  - Time and space separation.
- Decoupling
- Overall performance improvement -> Concurrency

## Liabilities
- Complexity
- Single-request performance may worsen.
- Fire-and-forget requests are not suitable if a response is necessary.
- Feedback loops:
  - A sends an event
  - B receives the event and responds with an event
  - A receives the event and also responds with an event
  - Repeat infinitely
- Events can get lost if not handled.
- Memory usage

## Ring Buffers
Ring buffers allow continuous adding and deleting of events without shifting elements.

## Aggregating Events
Duplicate entries can be aggregated within the queue -> for example, avoid to play the same sound twice, or even worse, twice the volume.

The window for looping through the event queue is not umlimited. It might be necessary to do this in a different function -> update(), or you might add a hashmap for content.

### Concurrency
Make sure to always put the function that will be run on the event into another thread if it does something specific -> playSound, please don't use the same thread there.

### Queues
- Single Cast
- Request
- Broadcast
  - Event to all listeners
  - Events often filtered by listeners
  - Performance issues if too many listeners or events
  - Zero listeners -> Discard event
- Worker Queue
 - Split events
   - Different listeners get different events -> more like a thread worker queue
