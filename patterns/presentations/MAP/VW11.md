## Component
How can a single entity span multiple domains without coupling the domains to each other?

Problem: 
- Creating monolithic classes that handle multiple responsibilities is hard to change
- A game character class that handles input, sound, physics and the rendering. This becomes a large file very quickly.

Solution: 
- Place the different components into different classes. Input into InputComponent and the game character has an instance of it. Entity is reduced to a container of components

Benefits:
- Components become reuseable packages
- Developers can work on a component without needing knowledge on how other components work

Liabilities:
- More complexity
- More indirection

### Additional Information
#### Diamond (or why not to use inheritance)
This refers to a class inheriting from 2 classes which in return will inherit the same class. This leads to undefined behavior as the system can't determine which function to use.

#### ECS (Entities Components Systems)

This takes the component pattern to the extreme by only storing ids of components. This allows for fast queries of components, which in return solves the complexity of component interaction:

#### Data Locality
Accelerate memory access by arranging data to take advantage of CPU caching (L1, L2, L3 cache). Components are often stored in contiguously, which means they are spatially local. This reduces the need to fetch data from slower levels of the memory hierarchy and improves access speed.

#### Polymorphism
Instead of attaching a component directly, one can also use pointers in order to provide more flexibility. This would mean you can create versions of a specific component to attach -> a player might want a player-input component, which in return is a input component.
With this a different type of player can have a different input component, or the same player on a different level etc.

```cpp
// class stuff
private:
  InputComponent* input;    // can be casted and hence dynamic
  PhysicsComponent physics; // can't be casted -> always the same functionality
```

Benefits: 
  - flexibility
  
Liabilities:
  - indirection
  - Vtable

#### Communication options
- Container state / global state
  - multiple writers can lead to race condition
  - 1 writer / multiple readers -> for true "state" values
- Directly
  - parent to child
    - child to parent needs inheritance
  - simple and fast
  - not flexible
- messages
  - good when recipient might need to respond or handle the action immediately
  - can be combined with queue
  - broadcast
  - see bevy example above with "EventReader"

## Questions
Is inheritance preferable to composition? - No

The component pattern creates more objects which decreases the performance, can data locality help to decrease the performance losses? - yes
